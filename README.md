# pandas-challenge

This challenge evaluated our foundations of python and their applications with pandas library. The challenge pushed me to aggregate my foundational knowledge of python sytnax and the new functionality of Pandas to manipulate our data. Jupyter notebook was definitely friendlier to use, but Visual Studio Code set the standard for writing continous code. I am coming away much more confident with the overall syntax, and evaluating different functions needed for data manipulations.  

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The dataset under analysis delves into performance of fifteen high schools in district-wide standardized tests. Upon further manipulation of the dataset, crucial statistics pertaining to the schools size, respective per-capita spending and subject-wise test performance can be unearthed. It is important to note that the data-set assesses the performance of seven district schools and eight charter schools, to provide a more balanced analysis.

Observations:

Examining the disctrict as a whole, average math and reading scores are close but passing percentages of reading is higher - signifying for needed improvement in math curricula. Overall passing rate is lower than individual passing rates, appearing as if students are struggling to straddle both subjects.

When examining the data-set further, some key observations can be made. To first establish, charter schools are the highest performing schools at an average of 90.7% (by % Overall Passing) and district schools are the bottom performing at an average of 53.7%. A more nuanced understanding of the data is required to understand this gap. When analyzing schools by size - all schools classified as 'large'(2000-5000 students) are district schools, where as charter schools vary between small and medium student bodies. Small and Medium student bodies average at 89.5% overall passing grades, and 'large' Schools drop to 58%. This observation concludes that performance in district schools is likely suffering due to overpopulated classrooms, and resources must be redistributed to adequately staff the higher populated district schools. To enhance this analysis, an enlightening data addition would be the teacher to student ratio in the charter schools versus district schools.
