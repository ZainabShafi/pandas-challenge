# pandas-challenge

## Overview 

This project evaluated our foundational Python skills along with their applications using the Pandas library. It pushed me to combine my knowledge of Python syntax with the functionality of Pandas to manipulate the provided dataset. Although Jupyter Notebook was more user-friendly, Visual Studio Code set the standard for writing continuous code. Through this project, I've gained more confidence in syntax and evaluating different functions needed for data manipulations.

## Technologies Utilized
Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

## Skills Demonstrated

Data manipulation and analysis with Pandas

Data cleaning and preparation

Grouping and aggregating data

Data visualization

Understanding of descriptive statistics

## Project Structure

### Data Preparation: 

Reading and merging school and student data, preparing the data for analysis.

### Coding Logic 

**District Summary:** Calculating key metrics for the entire school district.
**School Summary:** Generating a summary of key metrics for each school.
**Top Performing Schools:** Identifying the top performing schools based on overall passing rate.
**Bottom Performing Schools:** Identifying the bottom performing schools based on overall passing rate.
**Scores by Grade:** Analyzing average math and reading scores by grade level.
**Scores by School Spending:** Investigating the relationship between school spending per student and academic performance.
**Scores by School Size:** Analyzing how school size affects academic performance.
**Scores by School Type:** Comparing academic performance between charter and district schools.

### How to Use

**Data Files:** Ensure you have the necessary data files (schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv) located in the Resources directory.

**Setup:** Run the Jupyter Notebook cells sequentially to load, clean, and analyze the data.

**Analysis:** Review the findings and visualizations generated in each section to understand school district trends and performance factors.
